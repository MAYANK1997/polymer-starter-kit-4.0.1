Step1: On Restricted List, we would need a new tab called ““Wall-crossed Issuers”

Upon clicking on tab, user should be taken to new page

There should be below options as we have on “Restricted Issuers” tab

Insert New Entry

Clear Filter

Export option


Step2: On Wall-crossed Issuers, when user clicks on “Insert new entry“, user should see a pop-up window with input fields as below

The pop-up should have title “Enter Issuer details“. Display a note in bracket (At least ISIN or Ticker is mandatory)

Issuer Name - Text field to accept Issuer name

Issuer Type - It is dropdown with values - Public/Private

Ticker

ISIN

CUSIP

SEDOL

Button - “Fetch Issuer Details”

When user clicks on “Fetch Issuer Details button“

Need to validate if user has entered valid ISIN or Ticker

And if yes, then fetch the details using SAPI and display in fields on pop-up window

If the data is not entered in above field or entered data is invalid, throw an error message -

“Please enter valid ISIN or Ticker, the details entered may not be valid“ and have close option to close the window




Step3: This is next step after IT-3812: Restricted List - Wall-crossed Issuers - Insert New Entry
In Progress

When user enters valid details, and we can fetch the details from SAPI or source we decide, those would be displayed on pop-up

The “Fetch the Issuer Details“ button should be turned as “Search Issuer Holdings”

Compliance user can validate the details displayed an clicks on “Search Issuer Holdings”

Then, we should send the request to Sirius and get all the details and receive holding details from Sirius

The holding details can be split in two sections

Holdings - It should display below details

Step4: On previous page, if user clicks on “Proceed to Wall cross“ button,

User should be displayed with pop-up for “Add new Restricted Issuer“ pop-up which comes upon clicking “Insert new entry” button on “Restricted Issuers“ page

The popup should display all previously fetched values like Issuer Name, Type, ISIN, Ticker, SEDOL, CUSIP

And should allow to user update and enter details in all fields including Restriction Category

Once user enters all valid details, the restricted issuer should be added to restricted list mentioned and flow should work as is


After user submits it, the entry should be displayed on Wall-crossed Issuer tab

Each record would have details for below columns
