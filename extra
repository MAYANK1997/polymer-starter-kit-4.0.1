We have to create a new portal

The  title of the portal would be  - Web Data Extraction

It would have logo as in design

There would be only one page

The fields on page are as below

A Text field - The name of field is URL. It is text box, should accept URL

There is note below text box - “Enter the link for URL you would like to scrape“

Another text box - with name “Keywords:“ - it should accept comma separated email IDs

The note below text box would be “Add keywords, you would like to search for. More than one keywords can be separated by comma.“

Daily Email Notification: With options Yes and No as radio buttons

The filed Time should display time for all 24 hours, in terms of AM and PM, user should be able to select one entry in time dropdown

The time field should be enabled only when user selects Yes option

A Submit button - used to submit URL for web scrapping

Email the Results button - to email the results

Below the area to display results



Refer the ticket https://loim.atlassian.net/browse/IT-3765 for detailed design

When user enters valid URL, and keywords and click on Submit,

The scraped links and results should be displayed in table as shown in design

If the URL entered is not valid - display an error message pop-up with message “The URL entered is not valid. Please enter a valid URL and try again“

If the URL is valid and no results are found, display message “There are no results for given keywords!“ 

If user selects daily notifications by setting the value “Yes” and time, and click on submit

The submitted configuration i.e. URL, Keywords and notification time should be saved until user changes them

We should be scheduling the email alerts to users’ email ID as per scheduled time on daily basis

The submit button should work and display result irrespective of user selected daily email notification

The daily notification email should follow the format provided in ticket https://loim.atlassian.net/browse/IT-3768 




The button “Email the Results“ should appear when user has searched and got some results

If results are displayed in table below, should have this button active

When user clicks on it, the results should be sent to user’s email ID

We may need to get user email ID through service based on login details, without asking user to enter it

Designs are provided in https://loim.atlassian.net/browse/IT-3765 

The Email should be as below
